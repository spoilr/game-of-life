  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <div class = "paragraph">
    <p> The Game of Life is a cellular automaton made by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, therefore its evolution is determined by its initial state and does not require any input from the user. You can create an initial configuration and then observe how it evolves. The first appearance of the game was in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column, in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American.</p>
   
    <p> Conway was interested in a problem presented in the 1940s by mathematician John von Neumann, who attempted to find a hypothetical machine that could build copies of itself. He found a mathematical model for such a machine with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid. The Game of Life represented Conway's successful attempt to simplify von Neumann's ideas. </p> 
     
    <p> From a theoretical point of view, the game is considered to have the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within Conway's Game of Life. </p>
    
    <p> The game opened up a whole new field of mathematical research : the field of cellular automata. Because of Life's analogies with the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to the class of "simulation games" (games that resemble real life processes). </p>
