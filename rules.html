    <p id="parag"> The Game of Life is a 30x30 grid of square cells, each of which can be in one of two states, alive or dead. Dead cells are coloured grey, while live cells can be red or green. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: </p>
      <ul id="rules">	
        <li> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population. </li>
        <li> Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. </li>
        <li> Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. </li>
        <li> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction, inheriting the majority colour of its neighbours. </li>
      </ul> 


    <p id="parag"> Life runs in turns, a new generation being created by applying the above rules simultaneously and updating the cells accordingly. The number of live neigbours is based on the cells before the rules were applied. That is, we must first find all cells that need to be changed before updating any of them. </p>

    <p id="parag"> Changes to the grid are possible so long as the board is not being currently updated. </p>

      <ul id="rules">	
        <li> Pressing the left mouse button changes the cell under the pointer to red. </li>
        <li> Pressing the right mouse button changes the cell under the pointer to green. </li>
        <li> Pressing the middle mouse button changes the cell under the pointer to grey. </li>
      </ul> 



    <p id="parag"> A label at the top of the screen shows the number of turns that there have been (this is initially 0), while another one shows the number of coloured cells currently on board. </p>
