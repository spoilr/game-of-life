  <h2>MVC</h2>


<div class="paragraph">
  <p> When creating an interactive application, the interface has to be separated from the functional core, otherwise changes will spread over many modules. </p>
  <p> We need to maintain a separation of concerns in the code so that :   </p>

  <ul>
    <li> changes to the user interface should be easy to make </li>
    <li> changes to the user interface should not affect the functional core of the application.  </li>
  </ul>

  <center><img src="mvc.png" height="250" width="250" align="center"> </center>

  <p> MVC pattern divides the application into 3 areas :  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Model - encapsulates core data and functionality. It must be independent of output representation or input behaviour. The model responds to requests for information about its state(from the View) and responds to instructions to change state (from the Controller). It has no direct knowledge of the View. Model takes a Board and does all the required modifications on it.</li> <br>
    <li> View - displays information to the user and obtains its data from the Model in order to generate appropriate user interface.  The Display class that implements the View is updated according to the model. It contains the buttons for the cells, the glider (to change the speed) and the buttons to handle the game.</li> <br>
    <li> Controller - defines application behaviour, handles the interaction between the system and the user. Controllers receive input such as mouse inputs(usually called events), notifies the Model of the user action, making the Model and the View to change as appropiate. It contains the implementations of the 4 different classes that extend ActionListener.</li> <br>
  </ul>

  <p> The implementation of Game of life makes use of this pattern. In this case, the Model handles the logic of the game, by applying the rules (when a cell dies, when a cell becomes alive inheriting the majority colour of its neighbours). </p>
  <p> The View displays the information to the user : the grid, number of steps that the game has run, a slider to change the speed according to which one step of the game is done and 3 buttons that control the game : Clear (which kills all the cells and sets the turn count back to 0 and the number of coloured cells currently on board to 0), Step (applies the rules once and updates the grid) and Run (which applies the rules until the user pauses the game).</p>

  <h2>Template Method</h2>

  <p> The Template Method separates things that change from things that stay the same. It defines the skeleton of a method, deferring some steps to the subclass.
  <p> In order to remove the duplication that would appear if we designed 2 boards : "normal" grid and "edgeless grid", we extract the superclass to deal with the common code, leaving the calculations for the specific board to be handled by the subclass. </p>
  <p> Board is the abstract class that implements the common behaviour, while Grid class handles the neighbours and colours with respect to the edgeless representation.

  <h2>Strategy</h2>

  <p> Display class implements the View interface which has basic operations for a game : updating, enabling and disabling buttons. </p>
  <p> This is useful if in the future we decide that we want to have multiple views : we capture the abstraction in an interface and implement the details in the derived classes. </p>
  <p> As it can be seen from the diagram, we make use of the interface, and depending on the context we create a concrete class that implements a specific behaviour. </p>

  <h2>Command</h2>

  <p> Command patters is used to encapsulate a request in an object and to allow the parameterization of clients with different requests. </p>
  <p> There are two types of buttons used in the Game of life that have the same behaviour:  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> control buttons (Action listeners) </li>
    <li> grid buttons (MouseEvent) </li>
  </ul>

  <p> In order to avoid excessive creation of ActionListeners(the grid is 30x30 so this would result in 900 ActionListeners), only one listener is created and passed to each cell. </p>
  <p> Also, Clear, Step and Run buttons all implement ActionListeners. Only one listener is created and passed to these buttons, the identity of the button that was actually pressed being determined inside the ControlListener class and it is based on its text. </p>

  <h2>Adapter/Wrapper</h2>

  <p> Adapter pattern is used in order to wrap an existing class with a new interface. It is used to change the interface of an object, mapping the client interface to the adaptee interface.</p>

  <p> Game of life has an edgeless grid. Life makes use of this pattern when trying to access a cell at coordinates x, y : returning the colour of a specific cell, setting the colour of a specific cell. In order to represent the edgeless grid, a new class is used (Wrapper), so that its implementation is not visible to the rest of the class, since the user does not need to know how it is represented. Therefore, the code to count the number of surrounding cells does not depend on the implementation of the grid, and does not require 9 different cases.  </p>
