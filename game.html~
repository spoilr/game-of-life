  <h2>Patterns in Conway's Game of life</h2>


  <p> Conway's Game of life rules can be summarised as : </p>
  
  <ul> 
    <li> Patterns for which it can be proved that the population grows without limit shouldn't exist </li>
    <li> Patterns that apparently grow without limit should exist </li>
    <li> Patterns that change for a period of time before coming to an end after: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> all the cells have died </li>
        <li> the cells have settled into a stable configuration (that doesn't change or that oscillates) </li>
      </ul>
  </ul> 

  <p> Patterns that occur in the Game of life include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> static patterns (still) </li>
        <li> repeating patters (oscillators) </li>
        <li> patterns that move on board (spaceships) </li>
      </ul>

<br>

  <h2>Still</h2>

  
    <p> A pattern which does not change from one generation to the next is known as a still life. </p>
    <p> It can also be thought of as an oscilator with unit period. </p>

  <h2 style="clear:both">Oscillator</h2>


    <p> A pattern that returns to its original state after a finite number of generations is called an oscillator. </p>
    <p> Conway originally believed that no pattern could produce an infinite number of cells, but many counterexamples were found in the end. </p>
    <p> If the configuration doesn't move it is called an oscillator, otherwise it is called a glider/spaceship. It is not known whether oscillators of periods 19, 23, 38, 41, 43 and 53 exist, but it is strongly believed that they do. </p>
  <p> An interesting fact is that the blinker is the only known one cell thick oscillator.  </p>

  <h2 style="clear:both">Spaceship</h2>


    <p> A pattern that returns to its initial state after a number of generation but in a different location is called a spaceship.</p>
    <p> The speed of a spaceship is given by the number of cells that patterns moves during its period devided by the period length. </p>
    <p> Spaceships are most commonly categorized by their speed and direction. </p>
